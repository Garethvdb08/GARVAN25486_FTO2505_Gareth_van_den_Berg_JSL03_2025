# JSL03 Project Brief: Console-Based Task Manager

## Overview

This project involves creating a **simple task management system** where users can add **up to three new tasks** to an existing task array. Tasks are **stored as objects in an array**, each with a **unique incremental ID**. Users will enter task details via prompts, and the system will allow filtering to view only completed tasks. The project focuses on **array manipulation, user interaction via prompts and alerts, and console logging for task management**.

## Project Outcome

This project successfully establishes the core functionality for an interactive task management system. It features a clean, static user interface and a JavaScript backend that allows users to add new tasks by clicking the 'Add New Task' button. The system uses a series of prompts to gather task details, assigns a unique ID to each new entry, and stores them in a structured array. For verification, the complete list of tasks and a filtered view of 'done' tasks are logged to the browser console, demonstrating a solid foundation for future dynamic rendering and state management.
